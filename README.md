# MVC Temple in JavaFX
A template for quickly making a JavaFX application.
Feel free to use if you want just don't remove comments to give credit.
Reason for making this, 
1. I always forget JavaFX functions
2. For convenience
3. I don't like how IDEs code drag and drop stuff, it can get pretty messy
4. I don't like to code using IDEs

In the sample, click the text lol to append more lols.

## Windows 
Simply execute the run batch file to execute the program.

## Linux / Mac
Lol I don't have one so idk how you do bash files. You can still manually do these compile commands tho so glhf.
