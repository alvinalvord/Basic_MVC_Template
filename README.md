# Basic_MVC_Template
A template for quickly making a JavaFX application
Feel free to use if you want just don't remove comments to give credit
Reason for making this, 
1. I always forget JavaFX functions
2. For convenience
3. I don't like how IDEs code drag and drop stuff, it can get pretty messy
4. I don't like to code using IDEs
